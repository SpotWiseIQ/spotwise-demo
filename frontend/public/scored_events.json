            "description": "The Surrealism exhibition deals with the world of the subconscious and the instability of reality through the works of avant-garde artists like Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, René Magritte, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and Claude Cahun and the work of contemporary artists like Cindy Sherman, Tony Oursler, Penny Slinger, Yayoi Kusama, Sarah Lucas and David Lynch. Central themes include identity, gender, technology and mental health examined from different perspectives. The media work of the world-famous contemporary artist and filmmaker Marco Brambilla Heaven´s Gate (2022) is shown in the basement gallery of the museum as part of the exhibition. The writer André Breton published the first Surrealist Manifesto in Paris one hundred years ago on 15th October 1924. It brought about a revolutionary cultural movement whose ideas and practices spread all over the world and continue to exert an influence in the present day.A century after the birth of the movement, Surrealist thinking is once again extremely topical. In an age of great change and unrest, we are creating new visions of reality. Political and social instability, crises and wars, ever accelerating change and uncertainty about the future are unsettling our view of the world. Questioning our own conception of reality has once again assumed a central position, and old questions re-emerge in our search for answers. Looking at Surrealist works over a hundred years opens up alternative perspectives stretching from the past to the present.&nbsp;The exhibition examines Surrealism and its impacts from the 1920s to the present day. The works of the original Surrealists engage with the interpretations of succeeding generations. The dialogue between these works shows that Surrealism is not just an historical movement, but rather one whose influence extends up to the present day. The Surrealist stance reflects a way of thinking that is based on incompleteness and continual change. The interaction between the art of different decades makes the themes and subjects of the avantgarde seem more topical today than ever. The search for identity, transformation, irrationality, the questioning of reality and perception are all dealt with in contemporary works of art that bear a Surrealist stamp.&nbsp;The exhibition, which is divided thematically into six sections shows how Surrealist practices have called the present and the future into question in a critical and humorous way over the generations right up to the present day.&nbsp;The over 100 works on show in the exhibition present the diversity of Surrealist art: paintings, prints, sculptures, photographs and films. The exhibition has been organized in cooperation with the German Institut für Kulturaustausch. ",

The route follows the street network, on sidewalks and in park areas, as well as dirt roads/paths. There are no stairs along the route. There are traffic barriers at the street crossings, lowered at pedestrian crossings. In Hämeenpuisto, the route between Satamakatu and Kauppakatu is uphill. Route: Laukontori – Satamakatu – Hämeenpuisto (park dirt road) – Kauppakatu – Frenckelli via the bridge to Koskipuisto (where there is also a dirt road) – Hatanpää highway – Otavalankatu. Accessible parking space: There are some public accessible (streetside) parking spaces near the starting point Laukontori and the finishing point Otavalankatu, but their availability cannot be guaranteed. You can participate in the event with an assistant and/or guide dog. During the event tour, the speech will be announced through a portable loud speaker. The route mainly takes you through smaller streets and the park, but there may be more traffic noise, especially in the Hämeenpuisto and Hatanpää highway areas.

            "description": "Surrealism – A Collective Dream8.2.–10.8.2025Tampere Art Museum’s large-scale international exhibition displays Surrealism’s visions of reality as the movement celebrates its centenary and presents encounters between its pioneers and prominent contemporary artists. Central themes include identity, gender, technology and mental health viewed from different perspectives. The exhibition examines Surrealism and its impacts from the 1920s to the present day. The works of the original Surrealists engage with the interpretations of succeeding generations. The dialogue between these works shows that Surrealism is not just an historical movement, but rather one whose influence extends up to the present day. The themes and subjects of the avantgarde seem more topical today than ever. ",

            "description": "Auli Kaartinen (1960–2024) was an information scientist and photographer. She began photographing her circle of friends in the late 1980s, when norms related to gender and sexuality began to be challenged. A counterculture was created in communities, where indeterminacy and outsideness created freedom and gave space.&nbsp;In her photographs, Auli Kaartinen documented the everyday life and celebrations of her own circle. Auli Kaartinen took experimental self-portraits and photographed her friends in the studio. In her self-portraits, Kaartinen explored themes of gender, sexuality, power and death. She approached photography with ambition and developed her skills purposefully both behind the camera viewfinder and in the darkroom. Auli Kaartinen's photographs have been published in the books Uusin silmin (1996) and Julmia naisia (1989).&nbsp;The exhibition is on display at the community gallery Komuutti, which organizes small-scale temporary exhibitions in collaboration with researchers, artists and other partners. Komuutti's name comes from the words \"space for experimental museum activities\". Despite its small size, Komuutti's exhibitions deal with big topics and the community gallery is an important channel for the museum in its work on behalf of human rights and sustainable development.Accessibility information:The route to the venue is barrier-free.The museum's main entrance is at Väinö Linnan aukio at Väinö Linnan aukio 8.There is space for escort vehicles to stop in front of the entrance and there is one barrier-free parking space next to the main door.The nearest public transport stops are along Satakunnankatu, 200 meters from the museum.There is a doorbell at the main entrance at Väinö Linnan aukio, but no door opening button.The door is quite heavy to open and there are two doors in a row in the wind closet.The museum's information desk is located on the street level, immediately after the main door, to the left. There is a clothes rack in the street-level lobby, and there are locked lockers for storing items in connection with the rack. There is also a wheelchair available for loan in the lobby.The exhibition is located in the community gallery Komuutti on the second floor of the museum.The exhibition floor is accessible by elevator. There is a floor map in the lobby of the exhibition floor, which shows the location of the different spaces. On the exhibition floor, the space is located in the middle of the main exhibition hall and access to the exhibition space is otherwise accessible, but there is a threshold at the door of the exhibition space and there are uneven floors in Komuutti. The lighting in the main exhibition hall is dim in places and there are various exhibition structures on the route that are not in a straight line with each other, but rather meander somewhat.A gender-neutral accessible toilet is on the first floor of the museum. Guide, assistance and hearing dogs are welcome in the museum.There is no induction loop in the exhibition space. &nbsp;There is a Finnish introductory text about the exhibition in the exhibition space.",

            "description": "Children's Cultural Centre Rulla is located on the first floor of the Culture House Laikku. It is a colorful, stimulating, and grounding art and exhibition space. Normally, Rulla serves only children and families, but during Pride week, we open the doors exclusively for adults, for one night only. During the Adults' Evening, you can explore the exhibition and play areas in peace, rest, read, meditate, listen to audiobooks or music (with headphones), take a nap, and participate in a guided art workshop inspired by Tove Jansson's worldview and art.In the Art workshop at 17, we will try painting with acrylics and mixed techniques and create our own artwork. The workshop celebrates the 80th anniversary of the Moomins and Tove Jansson's unique creativity and attitude towards life. Tove Jansson (1914–2001) was a writer, visual artist, and illustrator who loved work and life, and her production is a celebration of humanism, colors, and storytelling. She is best known as the creator of Moominvalley and the Moomin stories. Tove surrounded the Moomins with numerous friends – the community and the power of art carry the trolls through life. The world of the Moomins is built on adventure and inclusion, where different perspectives are heard. (Source: tovejansson.com)The message of Manse Pride 2025 \"We are one big family\" fits perfectly with Tove's stories about a safe place that can be called home. In the art workshop, we strengthen the feeling of hope, the importance of belonging, and the freedom of self-expression through art. The art workshop is led by visual artist Zeynep Kaynar / Tampere Intercultural Art.The exhibition space at Rulla features the spring exhibition of the Handicraft and Design School Näpsä What on Earth? Fairytale Crafts.The entrance to Rulla is from the end of Laikku facing Tampere Theatre. Outdoor shoes cannot be worn in Rulla; there is coat rack space and lockable lockers in the lobby. We kindly ask you to keep smart devices silent during the visit.The evening concludes with Pride concert: Narrikoira &amp; Kiukkupussy and Elsi Sloan at 19:00 on Laikunlava!Free entry. Taking part in the art workshop is also free of charge.Tervetuloa * Welcome * Välkommen * Teretulemast * स्वागत * Bi xêr hatî * Bienvenido * Ласкаво просимо * Hoş geldiniz * Добро пожаловать * স্বাগত * Benvenuto * ようこそ * Willkommen * 欢迎 * Soo dhowow * Dobrodošli * خوش آمدید * مرحباً بكThe event follows the principles of a safer space.Accessibility information for Rulla.",

The party starts at 2 pm with a parade leaving the park (the parade starts at around 1:45 pm), which will tour the center of Nokia and return to the park well in advance of the program with speakers and performers starting at 3 pm! The park party will be celebrated with a picnic, enjoying the rainbow-themed program and exploring the stalls and offerings of the partners present. It is worth booking your own picnic blanket and a cheerful spirit! You can bring your own picnic snacks or buy them from the Vegaaniliitto stall. The event lasts about a couple of hours.The party is a free event for the whole family. We follow the principles of a safer space in all our events, which you can read in advance on our website (unfortunately only in Finnish)!",

            "description": "The Italian band DanzDas's annual European tour also extends to Finland! Here, as part of it, a Raw and groowy mini-tour will be held, which brings together three rough grooving bands. In addition to DanzDas, the band will also include Kesy from Kuopio and Gneissi from Tampere-Helsinki. \nDanszDas, who have toured extensively throughout Europe and are also heading to the United States next year, is influenced by composer Mirko Belzoni. Guitar, bass, synthesizer, drums and trumpet create a surprising and immersive mix of post-rock and electronic music in the lineup led by Belzoni that is guaranteed to move its listeners.\nKesy also brings musical joy to the tour with their rock'n'pop'n'punk music. The band, which has been praised for its unique songs and energetic and atmospheric gigs, invites its listeners on an adventure to the suburban bars of the past, the New York 77' underground and the traditional Finnish storytelling tradition.\nLike DanzDaZ, Gneissi, who perform electronic music with an energetic approach, has sailed through different genres over the years. With their latest album Galefeissi, they combine tones of hyperpunk, hyperpop and punk in their music. Present are the joy of creation, reflection on identity and finding hope in a world where sincerity and irony mix into a brown mass of modeling wax from which it is impossible to separate them.\nTogether, DanzDas, Kesy and Gneissi create a versatile ensemble that strikes at the heart of alternative music with mischievous power, and is not worth missing. There is raw groove at these parties!",

            "description": "Finding new friends and a community in the ropes hobby can be challenging, and finding a new ropes partner is even more difficult. We want to provide a space where the threshold for meeting new people is as low as possible. This event offers a relaxed and safe space to find new acquaintances and potential ropes partners.We will start the event with light group discussions and icebreakers that will help you talk about your hopes and expectations in the ropes community and ropes partners. Are you looking for a training buddy or a companion for workshops? Are you interested in rope dating, and if so, in what format? Or do you need a friend to attend jams and events with? After the group discussions, the actual speed dating part begins, where you can chat, try tying or just follow the atmosphere.The event is open to all genders and experience levels. You don't need any previous experience with ropes: The most important thing is an open mind and a desire to meet new people.We will be organizing three Rope speed dates on Monday, June 9th, 2025. The event will be a walk-in event and each start will accommodate 20 people. Starts at 4:30 PM, 6:30 PM and 8:30 PM. We will open the doors of Unisex at 3:30 PM. If there are spaces available, you can participate in more than one start.Come along to find community, new friends and maybe the right rope partner for you.The event is organized by Unisex and rope artist My_May.More information: tapahtumat@unisex.fi",

            "description": "What Is Left Behind is a series of mixed media collages, created out of the artist’s family’s discarded album photographs. The series uses our society’s ever-changing relationship to photography as a framework for examining themes of memory, loss, and presence.digital photo manipulation, the careful curation of social media and the new frontier of artificial intelligence generated images have chiseled away at our perception of the documentary nature of photographs. What Is Left Behind takes this abandonment of documentation in a different direction, replacing idealistic editing with analog photo manipulation, resulting in images resembling memories in all their haziness. The way we relate to the past is always evolving, our memories changing over time, some discarded along the way, the narrative of our identities forming and reforming throughout our lives. The series visualises these tendencies of the mind, warping the original photos beyond recognition and condensing a whole life into a curated selection of images.The theme of loss is present throughout the works. By destroying photographs inherited from their grandparents, the artist releases the captured moments into the vastness of history, the photographed versions of the images’ subjects vanishing forever. This type of permanent disappearance seems frightening at first, but the pieces approach this loss through solace. It’s a wonderful thing to let go of past selves, to not have them haunt us through our digital footprints, to destroy an image knowing that a backup of a backup will never resurface.&nbsp;The creation through destruction of the series acts as a dissenting voice in a world obsessed with eternal youth and perfection. Like molecules, the photographs break apart into atoms, reconverging into a new order. Death is required for birth, reminding us that nothing lasts forever, nor should it. Basking in the fleetingness of life gives an opportunity to to be fully present, the awareness of one’s finiteness acts as a catalyst to see what is truly important in life.Silja Tusa (b. 1999) is a Tampere-based visual artist who works mainly with mixed media collage and photography. They graduated from the Tampere University of Applied Sciences in 2024 with a Bachelor’s in Fine Art.  Tusa approaches each work from a place of honest subjectivity, weaving together personal experiences and universal themes. A recurring motif in Tusa’s work is the fleetingness of everything, the cycle of matter and life. This is reflected in their working process. Tusa creates their art mainly with recycled materials, destroying the old to create something new. They use a large variety of techniques, combining and playing with different materials, textures and pigments, resulting in unique pieces that are distinctly from Tusa’s hand. ",

June 4 – Art from Natural Materials We’ll gather sticks from the surroundings of Haihara and weave yarn around them. The resulting artworks can be used as decorations, for example, in a flower bed. June 11 – Paper Doll Create a paper doll that can be a human figure, animal, robot, or even an alien. We’ll also make clothes and other props for the character. June 18 – Tree Spirit We’ll sculpt a tree spirit from clay. You can take your figure home and attach it to a tree near your house, or we can place it on a tree near Haihara. Over the summer, you can observe how the artwork changes over time. June 25 – Window/Door Decoration We’ll make a paper house and glue natural flowers and plants into its translucent window opening. Participation is free! Instructor: Paula Maunu / Children’s Cultural Center Rulla. Organized by the City of Tampere’s Public Cultural Services.",

            "description": "Dance Theatre MD has evoked national treasures of Finland,&nbsp;the Moomins, into dance.&nbsp;Dancing Moominvalley&nbsp;is visually spectacular, fully composed dance theatre piece for the whole family. This popular, award-winning, all over the globe seen performance is based on&nbsp;Tove Jansson’s book&nbsp;The Tales from the Moominvalley.&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance opens up the well known themes of Tove Jansson’s books: invisibility, otherness and difference.The basis of the visual world of the piece are the original illustrations of Tove Jansson in the collection of The Moominvalley of the Tampere Art Museum (nowadays Moomin Museum). The world of the illustrations and the tales of Jansson are now interpreted on stage by the means of dance theatre.The piece is choreographed by Dance Theatre MD’s choreographer&nbsp;Samuli Roininen&nbsp;and the music is composed by&nbsp;Heikki Mäenpää. Dance, music and visual elements such as projections intertwine to interpret the holistic and fascinating world created in Jansson’s tales.The project Dancing Moominvalley @ Shanghai Expo was featured in the Finnish cultural program at EXPO 2010 and was presented at EXPO 2010 on August 2010. The project also recieved Shanghai EXPO 2010 Culture Award as the only one of the Finnish Pavilion Culture Program. In spring 2020 Dancing Moominvalley celebrated it’s 10 year anniversary!",

            "description": "The Impersonal&nbsp;is a long-term art project by photographic and media artist Spartak Khachanov. The work explores themes of migration and life in a refugee reception centre. The project is based on the artist’s own experiences as an asylum seeker living for two years in a refugee centre located in Vantaa, Finland, after arriving in the country as a political refugee in 2019.War and forced migration have shaped Spartak Khachanov’s life from an early age. He was born in Azerbaijan, from where his family fled to Armenia and later to Ukraine. Over the course of his life, Khachanov has been forced to leave his home four times. His most recent flight began in 2019, when his art provoked strong reactions in far-right nationalists, he received death threats and became a target of the radical right-wing group C14. In 2021, he applied for political asylum in Finland and spent two years at a refugee centre in Vantaa while awaiting refugee status. During this time, Khachanov began systematically documenting his surroundings and it’s impact on the people living there.In&nbsp;The Impersonal, Khachanov explores the refugee centre as a physical and psychological space. He documented his experience through photography, video, and sound recordings. The exhibition includes a photographic installation consisting of 1,400 disposable paper plates, each with a photo taken on an iPhone mounted in the centre. The images depict fellow residents, interior spaces, outdoor environments, and everyday objects from the refugee centre. The project’s title refers to the experience of invisibility and the erosion of identity: the refugee centre becomes a space where time stands still, and residents are pushed to the margins of society – trapped in a space between past and future. The work aims to shed light on the lived reality of those seeking refuge in Finland and raise questions about who refugees are, where they come from, and what kinds of situations they are fleeing.“A refugee centre is like a black hole in the landscape. Time loses its meaning, and every day is the same. You were taken from your home country like garbage, and the new society is in no hurry to accept you – or even notice you. Refugees are left stuck between the past and the future. They cannot return, but their future is vague.”Spartak Khachanov is an Armenian artist born in Azerbaijan and living in Finland whose work addresses political and societal issues such as war, instability, nationalism, and migration. He works with sculpture, installation, painting, photography, video, animation, and sound. His art has been shown in numerous exhibitions and festivals in Helsinki, Vantaa, Berlin, Madrid, New York, and Sofia, among others. His work has been featured in&nbsp;The Guardian,&nbsp;The Washington Post,&nbsp;Helsingin Sanomat, and&nbsp;Hyperallergic.",

Monoculture and unsustainable forest management in commercial forests are causing extensive spruce damage, which is accelerated by warming summers and mild winters.&nbsp;The work considers what kind of life bookworms and polygraphists, those other species of small bark beetles, live in commercial forests and what kind of destruction they slowly cause. Despite their destructive power, they consider spruces their refuge, and I wonder if people do the same with their clothes. The Nature Secret Society will present a moving performance in the work on the opening day, May 10, 2025, starting at 2:00 PM. The dance collective includes Tuuti Touhunen and Oona Leinonen, masters of dance arts, and musician Anna Pesonen.The performance lasts approx. 20 minutes.",

The stage will feature the play FORTITUDE&nbsp;or&nbsp;and GENTLENESS as well as excerpts of Siegenfeld’s dance works “No Way Out” and “The Sumptuous Screech of Simplicity”. The performances are based on the Standing Down Straight® method and the Jump Rhythm® technique, a vocally accompanied rhythm-driven approach to singing and dancing.FORTITUDE&nbsp;or&nbsp;and GENTLENESS is a play about a rehearsal for a play about two people, who have known each other for years as actors, finally begin to know each other as people. This unique play with music and dance incorporates everything from terror to tap dance to titillating tango. It encompasses a relationship that comes together, falls apart, and leaves us wondering what will happen next.Alongside the play, Peter Hammer, Saana Kulmala and Mariikka Santaharju will perform excerpts from two different pieces of Siegenfeld’s choreography: “No Way Out” and “The Sumptuous Screech of Simplicity.” With speed, energy and precise rhythmic play, Siegenfeld’s unique technique and style combines movement and expression to surprise, entertain and touch audiences’ hearts.Show will be performed in English.Duration: approx. 2 hAge recommendation: 15+TicketsGeneral admission 20 €Discount ticket 10 € (retired, students, unemployed, performing arts professionals)LocationStudio Liikelaituri, Yliopistonkatu 58 D, 33100 TampereThe doors will open 30 mins before the start of the show.If you require an unobstructed passage or a place for a wheelchair, please mention it when booking your ticket.Team:FORTITUDE or and GENTLENESSBook, Choreography, Musical Arrangements and Additional lyrics: Billy SiegenfeldPerformers: Jordan Batta (US) and Billy Siegenfeld (US)Director: Tucker DeGregoryAssociate Directors: Tor Campbell ja Taris HoffmanLighting: Eric SouthernProduction Stage Manager: Joshua WeckesserNo Way Out / The Sumptuous Screech of SimplicityChoreography: Billy SiegenfeldPerformers: Peter Hammer (FRA), Saana Kulmala (FI) ja Mariikka Santaharju (FI)In collaboration with Pirkanmaa Dance Centre.",

I believe life is meant for joy and love. In my work, I value storytelling, flow, and clarity. I’ve spent my life supporting people. I’m a Tantric Life Coach, certified mental coach, relationship advisor, and midwife.As a Tantric Life Coach, I help you find an alive connection to your emotions and your body. To me, tantra is a path of self-discovery – training the body and mind, walking a spiritual path, and exploring what it means to be human.In neotantra, we explore practices that help you access the deep feelings that live inside you. Layer by layer, old habits, social conditioning and limiting patterns peel away, revealing the beautiful, authentic you. From this place, true connection becomes possible, with yourself and others.Shadow work- recognizing your own wounds and triggers- is part of this journey. Through breathwork and body-based exercises, your senses become more sensitive and open to pleasure- perhaps more than you ever thought possible. I will always meet you with love, never from above.My events follow safer space principles, where everyone is welcome as they are. Discrimination, judgment, or harassment is not tolerated. If you experience inappropriate behavior, please speak to me or a support person immediately.My work is ethical and transparent. In couple exercises, I gently guide you and your partner toward deeper intimacy through tantric practices. I offer tantric coaching, mental coaching and group events for individuals and couples.Accessibility infoThis venue is&nbsp;not fully accessible: a small 3cm threshold and doorsteps must be crossed to enter.

Coffee, tea, juice, vegan delicacies and relaxing music will be served. Member of Parliament and city councilor Oras Tynkkynen will be joining the event, and welcomes everyone to chat about rainbow politics and any other issues that come to mind. Welcome to stop by for a quick coffee or enjoy the unique summer evening atmosphere for a longer time!Accessibility information: The event venue is on the corner of quiet little streets. There is a steep hill when arriving from Pohjolankatu, but from other directions the route is flat and easy to use. There is plenty of space for getting off the car, but you may have to look for a parking space further away. The bus stop is few street corners away. There are no toilets at the event venue. You can bring an assistant or a guide dog. There is no induction loop available. The kiosk window is at standing height, but it is easy to make your order without reaching the window. The event organizers will help when needed, for example by reading the menu aloud or bringing the servings to wheelchair users. There are some chairs for resting.",

            "description": "Welcome to join us for the environmental artwork!Location: Sorsapuisto, Tampere, 12–19 JuneHanging day: Thu 12.6. 15-19Dismantling: Thu 19.6. by 19Organizer: Sinuiksi ryRegistration: by 8.6.We will decorate the birch trees in Sorsapuisto with knitted graffiti in honor of Manse Pride week. We will bring crafts to pride and pride crafts. Tell us about your own craft group by participating in the event or show your skills by participating alone. If you wish, you can participate without your name being shared. Remember to register no later than 8.6. by using the form - early registration is appreciated.When making knitted graffiti, the style is free. In addition to knitting, you can decorate the tree by crocheting, sewing, embroidery or felting. The trees have a circumference of 60–80 cm and the trunks are 150–180 cm long. For example, a 100 cm long knitted graffiti for a 60 cm trunk needs about 27 pieces of 15 cm granny squares. If you want to wrap an 80 cm tree trunk in a 20 cm wide striped scarf, the scarf should be 200 cm long so that it covers the trunk by about 50 cm. You can also do smaller works as long as the work reaches around the tree.&nbsp;We are organizing a hanging event on Thursday 12.6. from 3–7 pm, where everyone can bring their work and sew it onto the trees. You can dismantle your own work independently by 7 p.m. on Thursday, June 19. Otherwise, the work will be removed and possibly destroyed. Unfortunately, vandalism to the work is possible, and damaged work will not be replaced.Fixing materials must not damage the trees in any way. Nothing may be screwed or nailed to the trees. Branches may not be cut. When dismantling the fastenings, care must be taken to ensure that no wires remain in the trees that could strangle the trees after the event.",

Surrealism – A Collective Dream8.2.–10.8.2025Tampere Art Museum’s large-scale international exhibition displays Surrealism’s visions of reality as the movement celebrates its centenary and presents encounters between its pioneers and prominent contemporary artists. Central themes include identity, gender, technology and mental health viewed from different perspectives. The exhibition examines Surrealism and its impacts from the 1920s to the present day. The works of the original Surrealists engage with the interpretations of succeeding generations. The dialogue between these works shows that Surrealism is not just an historical movement, but rather one whose influence extends up to the present day. The themes and subjects of the avantgarde seem more topical today than ever.  Welcome!",

Mahler composed his final symphony in the aftermath of personal tragedies. Little did he know he would die just two years later; yet, his Ninth Symphony has long been seen as his musical testament—an elegy overflowing with memories, a farewell where the sand in the hourglass inevitably slips toward the great unknown. This iconic work in the symphonic canon was last heard in Tampere 12 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;Season series concert | no intermission | pre-concert talk at 6 PMTickets: adults 34 € / pensioners 26 € / students, unemployed and conscripts 16 € / children under 18 years 10 €You can buy tickets from the Tampere Hall ticket office, Aplodi and the Lippupiste online store (Lippupiste adds service and order fees to the ticket prices, along with possible delivery and payment method charges).&nbsp;",

Inspired by the tales of One Thousand and One Nights, this symphonic suite takes the listener on a magical journey through the folktales of the Middle East. Only six years later, Claude Debussy made history with Afternoon of a Faun, where the elusive harmonies mark the dawn of modern music. Award-winning British composer and sitar virtuoso Jasdeep Singh Degun ties his North Indian roots to Western music. His sitar concerto Arya symbolizes the experiences of separation and unity: a lone hero challenges a group of like-minded individuals in a confrontation, culminating in a deep sense of connection.&nbsp;Season series concert | includes an intermission | pre-concert talk at 6 PMTickets: adults 34 € / pensioners 26 € / students, unemployed and conscripts 16 € / children under 18 years 10 €You can buy tickets from the Tampere Hall ticket office, Aplodi and the Lippupiste online store (Lippupiste adds service and order fees to the ticket prices, along with possible delivery and payment method charges).&nbsp;",

Drifts unleashes the full power of the orchestra, pulling the listener into deep, relentless ocean currents. Similar raw energy flows through Thomas Adès’s violin concerto Concentric Paths, which has quickly become a favourite among many top violinists. In Tampere, it will be performed by Swedish star Johan Dalene, making a welcome return as soloist with the Philharmonic. Sergei Rachmaninoff, then living in the United States, overcame his fear of the blank page one last time in 1940. Symphonic Dances, his final work, reflects nostalgia, longing, and the vivid presence of a life fully lived.&nbsp;Season series concert | includes an intermission | pre-concert talk at 6 PMTickets: adults 34 € / pensioners 26 € / students, unemployed and conscripts 16 € / children under 18 years 10 €You can buy tickets from the Tampere Hall ticket office, Aplodi and the Lippupiste online store (Lippupiste adds service and order fees to the ticket prices, along with possible delivery and payment method charges).&nbsp;",

            "description": "Anna Niskanen’s solo exhibition Oyster presents a collection of hand-printed photomontages  that transform the Mältinranta gallery space into a water-filled room. Water surrounds us and flows within us – the water in our bodies supports us. The movement, shimmer, and sound of  moving water remind us of our origins. \n\nThe materiality and surface of the large-scale, unique works emphasize the physicality and  labour of the process. The cyanotype, dating back almost 200 years, is a printing process in  which a light-sensitive emulsion is applied to paper, exposed to ultraviolet light, and finally washed with water. After exposure, the blue image appears when the chemical reaction forms  the Prussian blue pigment. \n\nVarious waterscapes blend together in the exhibition space. While individual sheets appear  abstract, placing them side by side in their entirety reveals new images of the element. The  photographs—captured at sea, on shores, in streams, by waterfalls, and of puddles—serve as a  starting point for the artworks. The edited pictures of nature oscillate between memories and  imagination. \n\nThe collages feature photographs taken during Niskanen’s residencies abroad, where she encountered different bodies of water. Niskanen has also travelled by sea: the movement from  one place to another can become a transitional space that offers a unique opportunity to  observe the surrounding environment and nature. Niskanen employs traditional methods of photography and printmaking to reflect on the significance of photography as a means of  preserving memories and as a source of imagination. \n\nThe accompanying written story, by Helen Korpak, suggests viewing the works as suspended scenes played by natural forces. \n\nAnna Niskanen (b. 1990) is a Helsinki-based visual artist. Her works explore the limitations and  conditions of photography and alternative printing processes. In 2017, Niskanen completed her master’s degree in Photography at Aalto University. Her works have been featured in group and solo exhibitions, including the Mänttä Art Festival, Wäinö Aaltonen Museum, Lianzhou Foto Festival, Centre de la Photographie de Mougins, Hippolyte, and Institut finlandais. She is also one of the founding members of the Kosminen collective.",

            "description": "&nbsp;The Curious -exhibition is a small collection of my latest drawings. At the center of each work is a forest animal surrounded by vegetation. The subjects for my works are usually selected according to which animal or plant fascinates me at that moment. Birds and mice have been a fairly familiar sight in my earlier works, but recently I have also been interested in insects and snakes, for example. My goal would be to occasionally bring into my works creatures that may arouse horror or disgust in some viewers. The inspiration for this is my previous fear of vipers, which over the years has turned into more of a fascination and interest. The drawing of a viper and swamp snakes could be considered a kind of main work of the exhibition, which is also the largest work I have drawn with a felt-tip pen to date. A large emphasis in my works is on the dot-like drawing technique I use. In recent years, I have also used a lot of paper cutting in my works, which is also visible to some extent in the works in this exhibition. The patient way of working creates drawings that you can immerse yourself in without feeling rushed. There is a lot of noise in the world around us and the flood of information is enormous, which causes stress, irritation and difficulty concentrating for many. With my own long-term working method and the small details of my drawings, I strive to create works that would act as a counterbalance to such a world. Piia Rantakangas (b.1993) lives and works in Tampere. Originally from Lehtimäki in South Ostrobothnia, the visual artist graduated from Kankaanpää Art School in 2017",

Keyboards are also included. Three members sing. All are men. Influences include Wigwam, Genesis, and Procol Harum. The lead vocals are by the drummer. The performers are in their sixties and have been playing together since 1986. P.O.M.O.Y. has performed at Ruovesi's Noitarock in the years '88, '89, '90, and '99. Since then, they have played at various family celebrations.\n\nAt 7 PM Frank Wienne Orchestra\nFrank Wienne Orchestra, a pop/rock band from Pirkanmaa, creates their own music in English, with key elements being melodies, dynamically varied songs, and a good groove.\n\nAt 8 PM Valley Nadir\nWe are Valley Nadir, a band from Tampere. Our music style is a blend of 90s grunge, Kingston Wall-style atmospherics, and various other influences. The band has been together for about seven years, and we've been performing regularly except during the pandemic. This spring, we will release our first full-length album, and we plan to play its songs at our upcoming gigs.\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

A little dog called Carmen also gets involved in the story!An astutely written and directed meta comedy about the nature of filmmaking, this Greek film playfully pokes fun at both itself and low-budget queer movies. Multiple layers of narrative feed together inventively to explore family relationships, friendships, romance, lust and even pet ownership for a group of 30-something guys. And as it knowingly grapples with issues of loyalty and masculinity, the film is warm, funny and very sexy.

Narri Koira is a desperate fruittari.Together they have spread the good news of gay eroticism all over Finland and have made an impact especially on the underground drag scene in Tampere. You may have seen them at Tavara-asema's Kväär events, Mansedrag at Kulttuuritalo Telakka and at numerous nightclubs and Pride events. Now Kiukku and Narri are celebrating the awesome Manse Pride all week long, including at Laikunlava on Tuesday!At 7:15 PM Elsi SloanElsi Sloan is a young queer musician and actress with a soul that oozes tender and fragile, but fierce and poignant artpop. Singing loud and powerful, Elsi's lyrics recount experiences of identity construction, finding the subjective and universal truths of love, and the crises that have coloured her journey. Elsi will be joined on stage by drummer Vilho Louhivuori and bass artist Saara Mänttäri.Accessibility information:The Laikunlava stage's grandstand is located in an artificial turf area, which is accessible.The grandstand has backless benches. The grandstand area is wheelchair accessible.There is no induction loop on the Laikunlava stage.The toilets at the Culture House Laikku are available until 8 PM. One toilet is accessible. The toilets are located on the 1st floor of Laikku, which is accessed from the end facing Laikunlava stage. Entry is by ringing the buzzer located at the door. The doorman opens the door remotely.The concert follows the principles of a safer event.",

The gaze does not belong to either, it is a relationship in which you participate.&nbsp;The dance piece Voyeur is about the gaze and its effect on the performer and the audience. What is communication without words?In the performance, the audience encounters a group of performers on a stage divided by a large window. The performers are on one side of the window and the audience is on the other. The window makes tangible the basic elements of a dance performance, people gathered in the same space to look at each other. Looking and meeting the gaze can be safely explored in the space created by the Voyeur. The work is non-verbal and communicates with the audience through bodily action, light and sound. In the subtle space of the performance, even small gestures and actions begin to speak and feel precious.",

At 6 PM Flaudient Flaudient is an energetic four-member youth band from Vesilahti, founded in 2023, that plays death/black metal, occasionally incorporating some melodic elements. Their gigs feature their own material as well as covers (e.g., Death, Amorphis). At 7 PM Suden Hetki Suden Hetki is a Finnish-language metal band from Tampere, founded in 2018. Their musical production navigates through atmospheric and grand melodies, heavy riffs, and strong narrative interpretation, leading the listener to the borders of sensitivity and partial madness, taking them on a journey into the darkest depths of the human mind. At 8 PM Decreation Decreation is a death metal band composed of old school veterans. Decreation will release their debut album in the spring through the French label Khaoszophy. If expertly played death metal makes your heart pound and your head bang, Decreation is a must-see live.See you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

            "description": "The Rewilding art exhibition at Haihara Stable brings together works by 7 different artists that deal with wildness in the environment and humanity.The artists in the exhibition, Johanna Ali-Tolppa, Hannakaisa Hautamäki, Minna Lumiluoto, Terhi Mäkkylä, Pirje Seppälä, Terhi Ulonen and Pirjo Virtanen, have studied together at Pirkan Opisto, an adult art school. The theme of the exhibition is Rewilding, which describes actions to correct nature loss.Rewilding is a global term for repairing nature loss where the original vegetation has lost its vitality, but other species can still flourish in the environment. On the other hand, the same phenomenon can be seen as an examination of a person's inner world and, for example, the process of creating a work of art.&nbsp;The artists in the exhibition also want to highlight the creativity and artistry that has developed through studying at the school, which has wildened their painting. Rewilding can also be an internal experience of the need to renew, release energy or let go of the inner self that is stuck in external demands. The exhibition asks; what died or disappeared because I had to make the choices I made before? The number of choices in an individual's life is often limited, you can't have everything, at least not at the same time, but is it possible to rewild something that has already seemed lost?&nbsp;Haihara Art Centre, Stable (Haiharankatu 30)June 7–29, 2025Open Tue-Sun from 1 PM to 6 PMClosed during Midsummer, June 20-22.Free admission to the exhibition.",

            "description": "In honor of Manse Pride Week, Sinuiksi ry is organizing two rainbow history-themed walks. The walks start on Tue 10.6. and Fri 13.6. at 6:00 PM from Laukontori. The walk lasts approximately 1.5 hours, ending at Otavalankatu. Participation in the walks is free of charge.Welcome to the parade sites of Tampere's rainbow history to see and learn! We will follow the principles of a safer space at the event. You can read the principles in advance here: https://yhdistys.sinuiksi.fi/toiminta/turvallisempi-tila/Accessibility of the venue and movement: The starting point Laukontori is accessible without barriers. The route follows the street network, on sidewalks and in park areas, as well as dirt roads/paths. There are no stairs along the route. There are traffic barriers at the street crossings, lowered at pedestrian crossings. In Hämeenpuisto, between Satamakatu and Kauppakatu, the route is uphill. Route: Laukontori – Satamakatu – Hämeenpuisto (park dirt road) – Kauppakatu – from Frenckell via the bridge to Koskipuisto (where there is also a dirt road) – Hatanpää highway – Otavalankatu.Accessible parking space: There are some public accessible (streetside) parking spaces near the starting point Laukontori and the finishing point Otavalankatu, but their availability cannot be guaranteed. You can participate in the event with an assistant and/or guide dog. During the event tour, the speech will be announced via a portable loud speaker. The route mainly passes through smaller streets and parks, but there may be more traffic noise, especially in the Hämeenpuisto and Hatanpää highway areas.You can ask Klaus for more information by email: klaus@sinuiksi.fi.",

Their setlist includes songs by Irina, Behm, Haloo Helsinki, Scandinavian Music Group, and others. The lineup consists of musicians and a female singer who have been involved in music for a long time and have gig experience spanning several decades. Vartin Yli's main goal is to ensure the audience enjoys themselves and the music. Their setlist includes well-known radio hits, but also less frequently played songs that the members themselves like. Vartin Yli is, above all, a feel-good band that wants to spread good vibes to the audience.\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

The band uniquely combines diverse music with personal lyrics that address equality and environmental and climate crises. In Lempivärit's rocking indie folk, the viola and woodwinds illustrate the twists of Finnish-language songs, complemented by the ukulele bass, guitar/banjo, and drums. However, the songs escape genre boundaries, taking the listener to surprising places and moods. In the summer of 2024, Lempivärit released their debut album, “Tehkää jotakin!”. Musically, Lempivärit follows its own progressive paths on the album. The lyrics take a broad stance while maintaining a twinkle in the eye.\n\nAt 7 PM Jäätelökone\nJäätelökone plays self-made folk-inspired pop music! The core elements of our songs are distinctive lyrics, changing moods, and thought-provoking tones. Our live set is performed with a cajon-based drum kit, guitar, bass, and keyboards, with vocal harmonies playing a crucial role. Join us in daydreaming or sing along!\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

            "description": "The Neue Sächsische Galerie's graphic art biennial is travelling during the Capital of Culture year of Chemnitz. Thanks to a cooperation with the German Cultural Centre and the municipal Laikku Galleria in Tampere, we are presenting our flagship project at a hotspot of the Finnish graphic art scene.&nbsp;The theme of the biennial is FIRE, FIRE!The fire is burning brightly and everyone is gradually realising how hot it is getting under their soles. We can no longer escape the conflicts of the world, we have to develop attitudes and gradually make serious adjustments to our actions. The challenges are lurking around every corner, even for us people who are used to peace. The good future can no longer be bought with money alone. Indifference is not yet punished, aeroplanes still fly and cars still drive at will. There are still living trees in our city centres. But those who can see can sense the impositions to come. They are likely to be painful. They will claim victims, always according to the thickness of their wallets. We are playing with fire.&nbsp;This year's Graphic Arts Biennale also wants to draw attention to increasingly inflammatory and aggressively escalating processes in social interaction. Parallel to the fatal treatment of nature, social disputes in the present day are leading ever more quickly to increasingly harsh confrontations. Statements replace dialogues. The search for common ground is becoming more difficult. Culture is becoming more important as a space for discourse and thus solutions. As a non-verbal source of inspiration, art can help to overcome speechlessness and find common ground with its less worn-out visual language.&nbsp;Professional artists in Saxony were asked to submit current works. As a result of the competition with a jury decision from 355 submitted works, the exhibition of 100 works was created. Award winners are: Kai Spade, Bettina Haller, Stephanie Marx, Stefan Knechtel, Juana Anzellini, Susanne Werdin&nbsp;Even if printmaking leads a marginalised existence due to its relatively minor importance on the art market, this biennial impressively demonstrates the inventive character of this diverse world. Thanks to the great commitment of workshops and printers in all three major Saxon cities, traditional techniques are being realised to the highest quality and the joy of experimenting with the new, mixing techniques and completely new applications of the developing technological possibilities knows no bounds. This seems to be the future of printmaking. On the other hand, this exhibition is a fascinating demonstration of what can still be achieved by limiting oneself to simple techniques such as lino printing. Statistically speaking, a renaissance of classic techniques can be observed. Linocut became the most widely used printing technique for the first time this year. Its ease of use, even without a printing workshop, also points to the precarious situation of many artists. The support materials are becoming more diverse and image creation is increasingly based on photographic impulses. Digital techniques remain in the background. They are not yet developing the creative powers we are looking for.&nbsp;Exhibition at Kulttuuritalo Laikku Galleria, Keskustori 4, Tampere. Open Tue – Sat 10am – 6pm. Free admission.

In Antti Kaski's (guitar, vocals) songs, which rise from the rhythmic corner of the folk bard niche, we soar from joyful surrealism to light-dimmed realism, not shying away from painful subjects. The structures of the music are greased with fierce dynamic transitions and sweetened with addictive, vocal-driven choruses. Gentle ethnic breezes hint at Kaski's history with Greek music, and the seductive harmonies of Janeveera (Eclipse Music) and Saana Kettu seal the catharsis.\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

At singer Kati Huvi's 70th birthday concert, you will hear evergreen hits from the 50s to the 70s. In her fifties, Kati Huvi left her job as a construction engineer and started singing. Although Kati had been singing in the yards of Pispala before she even learned to speak, fulfilling her dream required a lot of courage and persistent studying. Now, as a seventy-year-old singer, the pre-show nerves have turned into the joy of performing. Joining her are arranger, pianist, music teacher Krister Ojanen, skilled violinist Tuike Suomalainen, and bass virtuoso Tapio Ahonen. Everyone is welcome to celebrate Kati Huvi's journey as a singer. See you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

            "description": "The new exhibition is called the Mineral Gallery. Because the exhibition space is smaller than before, and the Mineral Museum's collection is very extensive, not all of the stones in the collection can now be exhibited. However, all of the most significant stone groups in the Stone Museum's collections will be on display, such as amethysts and other quartzes, chalcedony, fossils, sand roses, meteorites and of course all of the finest precious and jewelry stones from sapphires to amber. The exhibition will also feature touchable stone samples. You can also examine stone samples under ultraviolet light and search for fossils in the sand. The centerpiece of the exhibition will be the huge Stones in the Aquarium installation, familiar from the Power of Stone exhibition, presenting almost 70 stone species.\n\nThe Mineral Gallery will also be a temporary exhibition, and is intended to be on display until the summer of 2026. However, stone lovers need not worry, as the Stone Gallery is an important and spectacular stopover before the Mineral Museum's new and larger permanent exhibition, as soon as its space is freed up from the museum center's renovations and other temporary exhibitions.\n\nThe exhibition will also feature stones never before seen in Vapriikki. Some spectacular gems from the Mineral Museum's collections have been selected for display, which have not previously been exhibited in the museum center. Among these are precious stones such as fine rubies and precious opals, and slightly more special gems such as spodumene and zircon. Other spectacular new items will include bright green uvarovite and fine fish fossils selected from the collections' pearls. A couple of real mystery stones will also be on display, the names or types of which no one has yet been able to confirm. Maybe you are the one who will recognize these oddities from the stone world?",

            "description": "Ruamjai choir's performance Selkie – The Seal Woman features two stories about crossing boundaries, about corrective action, about understanding, about accepting reality and, finally, about forgiveness.The underlying narrative is an ancient tale from the shores of the northern ocean. A fisherman in the cold north sees silver-speckled seal women dancing on a rock at night. He steals one of the seal pelts and thus captures one of the selkies to be his wife. He promises to give back her seal pelt when seven summers have passed. The couple have a son, Ooruk, who despite his father’s protestations eventually helps his mother return to the sea and thus learns the connection between the two worlds.Interspersed with this tale are composer Tellu Turkka’s own diary entries from the period 2011–2018 about her devastating divorce and struggle to survive a serious illness. The work has nine movements and a duration of about 60 minutes.Admission is free, but pre-registration is required. Pre-registration will open in May.",

            "description": "Free open-air concerts offer experiences for everyone around Tampere.At 6 PM Luunyrkki Luunyrkki is a three-member band from Tampere, founded in early 2023, playing Finnish-language 77/hardcore punk. Stylistically, we don't want to be compartmentalized into any specific punk subgenre, but musical influences include Ratsia, Rattus, Nuket, Riistetyt, Pelle Miljoona, etc.At 7 PM Carillo A few years ago, the former girl band, now lady band, Carillo returned from a break and interprets the mindset of middle-aged women in their new songs. Both the songs and performances are seasoned with rough humor and self-irony. Their repertoire still includes the best of the eighties, albeit in re-arranged versions. These ladies are visible and audible!At 8 PM APS4 The observation class of the music play school plays fateful songs with the approach of a grass-scented park band, heading towards the inevitable and beyond with windshield wipers squeaking. The group, which has been playing together since 2015, rarely performs, so don't miss this opportunity!See you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

Though the dream of universal brotherhood remains unrealized, Ode to Joy is a powerful reminder of the utopia we must never stop pursuing. This season’s featured composer, Sebastian Fagerlund, made his breakthrough with the Teosto Prize-winning Ignite—an electrifying celebration of controlled chaos. Blending sci-fi soundscapes, medieval melodies, and exotic rhythms, it launches the listener on a thrilling journey to the eye of the storm—and back.&nbsp;Season series concert | includes an intermissionTickets: adults 42 € / pensioners 32 € / students, unemployed, conscripts and children under 18 yrs 20 €You can buy tickets from the Tampere Hall ticket office, Aplodi and the Lippupiste online store (Lippupiste adds service and order fees to the ticket prices, along with possible delivery and payment method charges).&nbsp;",

From this creative resurgence rose his Second Symphony—the lush pinnacle of his most prolific period. Its sweeping melodies sing of a love that soars freely and embraces the full spectrum of life. Between The Firebird and The Rite of Spring, Igor Stravinsky composed Petrushka—a ballet about a puppet driven mad by love. Folk tunes, frenzied fights, and obsessively tilting rhythms make Petrushka one of orchestral literature’s most captivating works.&nbsp;Season series concert | includes an intermission | pre-concert talk at 6 PMTickets: adults 34 € / pensioners 26 € / students, unemployed and conscripts 16 € / children under 18 years 10 €You can buy tickets from the Tampere Hall ticket office, Aplodi and the Lippupiste online store (Lippupiste adds service and order fees to the ticket prices, along with possible delivery and payment method charges).&nbsp;",

Béla Bartók’s duos echo with the yearning tones of Hungarian folk songs, while Aulis Sallinen’s most celebrated quartet plunges into the mournful depths of an Ostrobothnian funeral march. Inspired by the vast prairies of the American Midwest and the melodies of Indigenous peoples, Antonín Dvořák composed his beloved “American” string quartet, now a cornerstone of the chamber music repertoire.The concert is hosted by composer Minna Leinonen.&nbsp;The concert lasts about 2 hours including an intermission.&nbsp;Tickets: adults 18 € / pensioners 11 € / students, unemployed, conscripts and children under 18 yrs 7 €You can buy tickets from the Tampere Hall ticket office, Aplodi and the Lippupiste online store (Lippupiste adds service and order fees to the ticket prices, along with possible delivery and payment method charges).",

            "description": "Exhibition themeThe Landscape of a Century exhibition presents artworks from the OP Art Foundation collection, featuring paintings and sculptures by Finnish artists, spanning over a hundred years. A specific theme consistent throughout the collection is Finnish nature, providing us with a link from the past to the present. Nature has inspired several generations of artists, and the depiction of nature in all its diversity is seen both in modern and older works of art.In the exhibition, modern art pieces have been placed side by side with art from different eras, creating a rhythm of continuity. It is important to bear in mind that all art has been thought of as being contemporary in its own time.OP Art FoundationThe OP Art Foundation was founded in 1987 to promote music and visual arts. To fulfil this purpose, the foundation owns and lends high-quality instruments to talented young musicians. The foundation also owns an art collection and provides pieces for exhibitions organised directly with art museums and in collaboration with the Finnish Fine Arts Foundations association.The OP Art Foundation holds an important role in preserving Finnish cultural heritage. Its art collection is one of the largest private collections in Finland, comprising about 3,000 pieces and encompassing a wide and extensive selection of Finnish art history, including paintings, sculptures, graphics and textile art from the mid-1800’s to the present day.The collection also constitutes an obligation to the foundation. The collection must be understood as being part of the Finnish art reserve, currently held and maintained by the OP Art Foundation. It is important to fulfil the obligation of maintaining the artworks to ensure that the power of their message is also preserved for future generations.Kimmo Pyykkö Art Museum, 1st and 2nd floor",

From the very begin, the guitar has helped her express herself on the hardest moments, and followed her in her greatest adventures.&nbsp;Metsä-Annikki is telling us stories from spaces between dream and awake, life and death. All wrapped up in images, in things that ultimately weren't even about it.The journey takes you through the moss and ancient forest into the space. The songs will mostly be played as accoustic versions, and partly with synthetic sound effects involved.&nbsp;/////Both of the artists are releasing their own music in the near future, and their music is played on live for the first time in HAY Second Hand gigs.&nbsp;19:00 Metsä-Annikki20:00 Kauris(Miikka Heikkinen on synthesizers)FREE ENTRYWelcome!",

Desibeli described it in their four-star review as follows: “Everything has a sense of life, real weight, and depth”, “The band sounds positively international, with four-part harmonies crowning the whole.” SaintPolis's widely acclaimed debut album, Gears of the Heart Change, was released in early 2023.\n\nAt 8 PM HAKA\nHAKA is a rock band founded in Tampere. We've been playing together for several years, and everything works smoothly. Our songs describe various emotions and things in a cryptic, poetic way.

At 6 PM The Jack Flash Band The Jack Flash Band, a six-member Rolling Stones tribute band from Tampere, plays all the classics and a bunch of lesser-known gems from the seventies. Come join us for an enjoyable time with rock, blues, and country music, singing and dancing along. At 7 PM LEVELLING THE LAND Levelling the Land performs music by the English folk-punk band The Levellers. Leading the band is Brit Colin Hartley. At 8 PM Daniela Lila Daniela Lila is a rock band from Tampere, founded in 2023. Their music draws from punk, grunge, post-punk, gothic rock, noise rock, and more - yet the band clearly doesn't fit neatly into any one of these genres. The expression is fierce and intense, the guitar playing is raw and simple, the bass paints textures throughout the songs, and the drums are constantly in overdrive.See you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

            "description": "Free open-air concerts offer experiences for everyone around Tampere. \n\nAt 6 PM Luova Laura\nIn Laura Luoma's Finnish-language songs, metaphors about relationships are built against the backdrop of red-brick settings and lakeside landscapes. The melodic elements are based on the Finnish pop canon and the international piano-driven singer-songwriter tradition, with a touch of indie spirit. The Luova Laura trio also includes Jarkko Rikkilä (guitar) and Antti Niskala (percussion).\n\nAt 7 PM Kuollut Piimä\nKuollut Piimä is a duo from Tampere that deconstructs and pokes at the world. The drum machine rattles and the instruments distort alongside pop melodies. Sour milk (piimä) is sour in taste and thicker in texture than milk. The only thing thicker is the atmosphere.\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

            "description": "Free open-air concerts offer experiences for everyone around Tampere. The concerts at Haihara are held in Valjasvaja.\n\nAt 6 PM Anton V. Kivi\nAnton V. Kivi is a new singer-songwriter from Tampere, performing stripped-down, dark-toned indie folk. His music centers around minimalist arrangements built around acoustic guitar and captivating vocal interpretations, along with thought-provoking lyrics. In his songs, Anton V. Kivi addresses the unspoken pain points of humanity and societal themes such as the climate crisis and criticism of capitalism. The intimate atmosphere of the songs compels the listener to consciously focus on the music and reflect on the topics raised. The artist's debut single ”Huhtikuu (kukaan ei puhu siitä)” is the first release from his debut EP, which will be released in the fall of 2025.\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

Lydian has been performing with her band for years and started her solo career in the spring of 2024 with the debut single “HULLU”. Lydian sings about the pain points of humanity, and her music features a blend of passion, experimentation, and playfulness. This is also evident in Lydian's live performances, which are characterized by strong band dynamics and delicate vocal parts.\n\nSee you in Tampere Summer Park Concerts!",

            "description": "Lempeä open mic will be oozing queerness on Manse Pride-week!🫧In this event you don’t have to be queer in a pretty way or be afraid of being too political, too fierce or too rough! We’ll make space for every thought and feeling regarding queerness and/or pride, whether it’s a soft whisper of self love or an angry speech of hopelessness, or anything in-between! We recommend this event for over 18-year-olds. So far our events have been finnish-speaking only, but for this event we’re broadening our horizons to any language you’d like to share with and hosting will be in finnish and english!💫Before the actual open mic there will be two opening acts: Hannaeerika and AARRE! The event is free of charge. As per usual, at the back of the space there will be pens and paper for the listeners who feel like doodling. There will be a keyboard on stage which you can use in your performance if you’d like. You can sign up to perform in advance at lempeaopenmic@gmail.com, but signing up will also be possible at the event. To start, we’re hoping for your set to be max 10mins. Please tell your stage name in your message. 🫧Even though the event has a theme, you can share whatever you’d like. Our goal is to create a space for sharing especially for queer people. Openness to unfinished thoughts is still very important to us and we aim to keep the threshold to share as low as possible. Every performer will be met with open arms but we encourage you to check in with your own relationship to queerness and how and when to take and to give space.🩷See you next month, we are looking forward to this! 💫Hannaeerika is a wonderful new name in the finnish indie music scene. She’s a singer-songwriter, whose gentle and playful style captures the listener from the very first note. Hannaeerika is an artist who believes in true self-expression. Her songs are full of personal stories and the small, meaningfull moments&nbsp;in&nbsp;life.AARRE is a rapper and a transman. In his lyrics he covers his difficulties with men and manhood. The characters that have been hiding in the shadows will be released in front of the mic, it’s their time to come out",

            "description": "As part of Culture House Laikku’s 100th anniversary celebrations, another centenarian takes the stage at Laikunlava: Dallapé!Europe’s longest-running entertainment orchestra, Dallapé, celebrates an impressive 100 years in 2025. To mark the occasion, Juha Hostikka &amp; the Dallapé Orchestra will perform spectacular anniversary concerts and release a brand-new album titled Go Go.Founded in 1925, Dallapé has turned countless songs by Finnish songwriters into timeless classics and brought the international hits of their time to Finnish audiences. The giants of Finnish orchestral entertainment from Bruno Laakko and Georg Malmstén to Kauko Käyhkö and Rauno Lehtinen have all been key figures in Dallapé’s history. Not to mention Olavi Virta, who served as the orchestra’s guitarist and lead vocalist.In 2010, Juha Hostikka, who studied singing at the Sibelius Academy and saxophone at the Pop/Jazz Conservatory in Oulunkylä, took over as the orchestra’s leader and vocalist, restoring Dallapé to its 1930s glory.Meticulously crafted arrangements and a swinging sound are Dallapé’s trademarks. The anniversary concert will feature evergreen favorites such as Ikkunaprinsessa, Angelique, Muistan sua Elaine, Äänisen aallot and Jälleen soittaa Dallapé.The finely tuned 11-member orchestra will present beloved schlager melodies from across its century-long journey. An unforgettable evening of swinging and nostalgic music is guaranteed!LINE-UPJuha Hostikka, vocalsAnssi Nykänen, drumsHarri Rantanen, bassVarre Vartiainen, guitarNiko Kumpuvaara, accordionMauri Saarikoski, violinArttu Takalo, xylophone, vibraphonePetri Puolitaival, alto saxophone, fluteHeikki Pohto, tenor saxophoneTero Lindberg, trumpetAntti Rissanen, trombone",

For the Greens, equality and non-discrimination form the hard core of politics, which is not compromised on. Accessibility information: Bar Kuja is a step-free space located on one level. There is a wide ramp at the entrance. The bar's passageways are threshold-free corridors. There is an accessible toilet in the event space.",
